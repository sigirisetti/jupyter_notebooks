    "At the core of the NumPy package, is the **ndarray** object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of **homogeneous data types**, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance. There are several important differences between NumPy arrays and the standard Python sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original**.\n",
    "- The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the **same data type**, and thus will be the same size in memory. The exception: one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, thereby allowing for arrays of different sized elements.\n",
    "- NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences.\n",
    "- A growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are using NumPy arrays; though these typically support Python-sequence input, they convert such input to NumPy arrays prior to processing, and they often output NumPy arrays. In other words, in order to efficiently use much (perhaps even most) of today’s scientific/mathematical Python-based software, just knowing how to use Python’s built-in sequence types is insufficient - one also needs to know how to use NumPy arrays.\n",

    "## Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization describes the absence of any explicit looping, indexing, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "* vectorized code is more concise and easier to read\n",
    "* fewer lines of code generally means fewer bugs\n",
    "* the code more closely resembles standard mathematical notation (making it easier, typically, to correctly code mathematical constructs)\n",
    "* vectorization results in more “Pythonic” code. Without vectorization, our code would be littered with inefficient and difficult to read for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is great for operations that are naturally vectorized\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorized operations are precompiled routines that can be sent in batches, like\n",
    "\n",
    "* matrix multiplication and other linear algebra routines\n",
    "* generating a vector of random numbers\n",
    "* applying a fixed transformation (e.g., sine or cosine) to an entire array\n",
    "\n",
    "In a later lecture we’ll discuss code that isn’t easy to vectorize and how such routines can also be optimized\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Broadcasting\n",
    "The term broadcasting describes how numpy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations on numpy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators +, -, *, / and ** all act elementwise on arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, A * B is not the matrix product, it is an element-wise product\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides versions of the standard functions log, exp, sin, etc. that act element-wise on arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they act element-wise on arrays, these functions are called <b>vectorized functions</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy-speak, they are also called <b>ufuncs</b>, which stands for <b>“universal functions”</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, the usual arithmetic operations (+, *, etc.) also work element-wise, and combining these with the ufuncs gives a very large set of fast element-wise functions\n",
    "\n",
    "conditional extraction - applies condition element wise\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutability and Copying Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays are mutable data types, like Python lists. In other words, their contents can be altered (mutated) in memory after initialization\n",
