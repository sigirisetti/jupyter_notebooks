    "# Commodity Market Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial markets do not have supply side constraints, i.e., their availability in the markets is not restricted by any factors other than the characteristics of the assets they are comprised of and participants who are associated with them like exchanges, governments, traders, etc.  Commodities by their nature are governed by <b>seasonality, production methods, labor costs</b> (to name a few) which determines how they are supplied in the market. On the demand side however both markets tend to be relatively free.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lease Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The lease rate is defined as the rate at which the owner of the commodity lends and buys it back from the investor in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Storage Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "When a commodity is being stored it is said to be in the carry markets and it is not generic across each product in the asset class.  The cost of storing it should be factored in the forward price. This makes commodities different from financial assets because apart from the financial cost associated with them there is also a cost of storing them which increases the forward price and makes the forward interest rate curve steeper than the normal curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convinience Yield\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits from holding the commodity that result from the physical ownership of the asset are termed as the convenience yield. It is owner specific and may or may not be reflected in the forward price.  When the commodity has been loaned out the investor loses out on this yield but saves on the cost of storing the asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>In commodity markets there can be considerable uncertainty about the net convenience yield</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Factors that affect commodity prices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Production related – Commodities are capital-intensive products i.e. they are influenced by natural factors like weather conditions, crop diseases, size of land cultivated and factors related to production like labor patterns, development in the tools and technologies used. Other than these there are factors like the economic and political environment which manifest itself in the form of trade constraints, subsidies, taxes to mention a few. Altogether these factors affect the cost of producing the commodity and the demand for it in a market where there is more than one participant.\n",
    "- Storage and Transportation constraints – All commodities have a real physical form and therefore there is a need for storage prior to distribution. This is not the case of financial products so inventory cost and storage do not have such a large impact on the market prices. This factor does not however affect the prices across all commodity asset classes in the same magnitude but rather depends on the type of commodity in question.\n",
    "- Economic and Demand related patterns – In recent times the uncertainties in the global financial system have made commodities a favorable investment alternative to financial instruments.  Typical examples would be gold and silver. The increasing involvement of  developing markets as suppliers expose the prices to the political and production related constraints in these countries like economic policy, infrastructure and labor conditions. This sometimes pushes prices higher.\n",
    "- Costs involved in storage – There are two types of costs involved in storing commodities. One is the financial cost and the other is the cost of physical storage and they both need to be factored in when computing the forward prices.\n",
    "- Seasonality – Some examples of such factors include weather related patterns, operational risk, climatic conditions and politics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis is the difference between the market prices of the spot and the futures (or forward). Since the futures or forward price converges to the spot price as t → T, the basis is zero at expiry\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Basis=Cash Price (S) - Futures Price (F) </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to expiry there are three components to changes in the basis, due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* maturity;\n",
    "* interest rates, dividends, carry costs and convenience yields; and\n",
    "* fluctuation of the market price of the futures within its no arbitrage range.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basis Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of basis risk in the commodities markets is similar to basis risk in financial products.  It occurs when spot price and the futures price do not converge when the futures contract expires. \n",
    "\n",
    "This happens in two situations. \n",
    "- In the first case the risk associated with a commodity price exposure cannot be entirely hedged using  any of the commodity futures contracts trading in the market due to a quantity mismatch. \n",
    "- The second case is when cross-hedging needs to be resorted to when there are no available future contracts trading on the market for the commodity in question. Cross-hedging happens when either the maturity, quantity or the quality of hedge cannot be matched with the price exposure to that needs to be hedged.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Carry Markets and Forward Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "A commodity is said to be in carry when it is being stored rather than traded. The concept is similar to financial markets where this term is called the financial cost of carry\n",
    "\n",
    "# Forward Price of a Commodity\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{0,T} = S_0 e^{(r - \\delta) T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where <b>r</b> is risk free rate at which the value of an asset grows in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In financial markets $\\delta$ is normally associated with the returns that arise from holding the asset. An example would be when an asset pays the dividend. This is called the dividend yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Impact of Storage Costs and Convenience Yield\n",
    "\n",
    "The price of the commodity calculated in the future must factor in both the <b>financial cost of carrying</b> the commodity as well as the <b>physical cost of carry</b> i.e. the cost of storing the commodity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The impact of the storage cost is to make the graph of interest rates for commodities steeper than the normal interest rate structure</b>. The advantage of lending a commodity is that the owner saves on the storage costs. However there is a disadvantage that the owner loses on the benefits of holding the commodity which in markets terminology is called the convenience yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lease rate\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\delta = c - \\lambda$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where δ is the lease rate, c is the convenience yield and λ indicates the storage costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lease rate can also be represented as the difference between the <b>commodity discount rate α</b> and the expected growth rate of the commodity price g.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\delta = \\alpha - g$ \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>From the above relationships it becomes clear that the forward price moves in an opposite direction to the convenience yield and this is opposite for the storage costs.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Strip Hedge and Stack Hedge in Commodities Market\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strip Hedge\n",
    "\n",
    "A strip hedge happens when futures contracts over many maturities ranges are purchased to hedge the underlying cash positions. In other words strips of futures contracts are used. This normally happens when there is high liquidity for futures contracts over longer time horizons. There is no basis risk due to the strip hedge as the basis becomes locked and changes cannot affect the risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack ad Roll Hedge\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of hedging involves purchasing futures contracts for a nearby delivery date and on that date rolling the position forward by purchasing a fewer number of contracts. This process then continues for futures delivery dates until each position maturity exposure is hedged. It normally happens when there is no adequate liquidity for the long term futures contract traded in the market. The following are the risks involved in stack hedging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hedging with futures and forwards\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is concerned with <b>hedging a cash position</b> with a forward or futures contract. What do we mean by ‘hedging a cash position’? We should make clear from the outset that securing a price in the future by buying or selling a forward or futures contract now is equivalent to securing the fair spot price now, if the spot price exists. It is this cash position that is hedged\n",
