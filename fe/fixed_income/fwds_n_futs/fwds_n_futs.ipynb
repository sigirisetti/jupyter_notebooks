    "# CHARACTERISTICS OF FUTURES AND FORWARDS\n",
    "\n",
    "- The difference between the cash or spot price and the forward or futures price is called the <b>basis</b>. \n",
    "-  Prior to expiry the basis is non-zero in general, but at expiry the price of the futures is equal to the spot price, since both prices are for immediate delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interest Rate and Swap Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "- An interest rate futures contract has a fixed expiry date, whereas an FRA is to buy or sell a forward interest rate with fixed time to expiry, i.e. with a fixed term\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quoting Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Three-month interest rate futures are quoted as 100 minus the 3-month LIBOR rate.By contrast, the FRA is simply quoted as the current value of the forward interest rate.\n"
