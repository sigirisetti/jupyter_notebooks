    "Python's standard library's datetime module is deliberately limited to non-controversial aspects that aren't changing all the time by legislative fiat -- that's why it deliberately excludes direct support for timezones, DST, fuzzy parsing and ill-defined arithmetic (such as \"one month later\"...) and the like. On top of it, <b>dateutil</b> for many kinds of manipulations, and <b>pytz</b> for timezones (including DST issues), add most of what you're asking for, though not extremely explosive things like \"holidays\" which vary so wildly not just across political jurisdictions but even across employers within a simgle jurisdiction (e.g. in the US some employers consider \"Columbus Day\" a holiday, but many don't -- and some, with offices in many locations, have it as a holiday on some locations but not in others; given this utter, total chaos, to expect to find a general-purpose library that somehow magically makes sense of the chaos is pretty weird)"
